sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: sort1 was the slowest program to sort all of the files EXCEPT for the text files that were already sorted. sort1 was actually the fastest to sort these already sorted files. This speed aligns with the fact that The lower bound for running time of bubble sort is Ω(n). While the lower bound for Selection sort is Ω(n^2).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 was consistently the fastest program to sort all the text files.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: sort3 was the 2nd fastest program for the random and reversed text files and was the slowest program to sort the already sorted text files. This aligns with the fact that both the upper bound and lower bound running time for selection sort is Ω(n^2).
