#### Description: 
Stop procrastination with this Chrome Extension! Focus mode is a chrome extension that uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
What Focus Mode does is it tries to limit the amount of time you spend on distracting websites such as Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitch, and Twitter. 
If you visit any of these sites with Focus Mode enabled, the extension will remove the main contents of the page and replace it with a motivational quote and a message reminding you to not get distracted. There will also be a button that you can press to restore the website to it's original state.

The extension is comprised of a main.js file, a manifest.json file, a popup.html file, a styles.css file and a folder with multiplte image files. 
The manifest.file uses JSON format to describe the important information about the extension. 
The main.js file is the main file that removes the elements from website and replaces those elements with the message, image, and button. 
The popup.html file contains the html for the small popup window that appears if you click the extension icon.
The styles.css file contains the CSS for popup.html.
The src folder contains the image files for all the motivation quote images (10 in total).
